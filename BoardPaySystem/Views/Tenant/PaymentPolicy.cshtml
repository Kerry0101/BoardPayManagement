                    <strong>10% Interest on Late Payments:</strong> If your bill is not paid by the due date, a <span class="text-danger fw-bold">10% interest</span> will be automatically added to your total bill amount.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How is the interest calculated?</strong> The 10% interest is based on your total bill (including rent, utilities, and other charges).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>When is the interest applied?</strong> The interest is applied immediately after the due date passes. Your new total due will be updated in your account and reflected in your next statement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How to avoid extra charges?</strong> Always pay your bills on or before the due date. You will receive reminders via SMS and notifications in your account.
                </li>
